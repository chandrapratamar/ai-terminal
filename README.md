## WebTUI CSS Integration

This project uses WebTUI CSS library to create a terminal-like UI. WebTUI CSS provides utility classes and styling for building terminal-inspired interfaces:

- Uses `box-` attribute for styling containers
- Uses `is-` attribute for styling components
- Uses CSS variables for theming

## Project Structure

- `/app` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `/components` - React components
- `/styles` - Global CSS and WebTUI CSS imports

## API Keys

To use the chat interface, you'll need to provide your own API keys for:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Deepseek

These keys are stored locally in your browser and are never sent to any server except the respective AI provider's API endpoints.
